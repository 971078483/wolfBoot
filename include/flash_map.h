 * 1. This system map could be in a file within filesystem (Initializer

 * 2. Map could be at fixed location for project (compiled to code)
 * 3. Map could be at specific place in flash (put in place at mfg time).

 * match the linker scripts when platform executes from flash,
 * and match the target offset specified in download script.
